# So what?

There is two options. First is making TypeScript as explicit dependency, and second is making TypeScript as explicit peer dependency. Both of them has same issue with version control.

## Version control for what?

Do you remember that ts-morph decided to embed typescript due to its unstable `compilerOptions`<swm-token data-swm-token=":deno/common/ts_morph_common.js:2546:3:3:`            const compilerOptions = getCompilerOptions();`"/>?
